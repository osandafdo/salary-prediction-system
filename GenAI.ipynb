      "Let's break down the attributes and their likely impact on salary:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Positive Factors:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **ExperienceYears: 10** (Very strong positive)\n",
      "*   **Age: 35** (Consistent with high experience)\n",
      "*   **Certifications: 2** (Adds value)\n",
      "*   **HealthInsurance: 1, FlexibleHours: 1** (Indicates a more established company, though these are benefits, they often correlate with better base pay)\n",
      "*   **Industry: Tech** (Generally higher salaries than other industries)\n",
      "*   **Education: Masters** (Highest degree, strong positive)\n",
      "*   **JobTitle: Lead Engineer** (Senior, leadership role, commands higher pay)\n",
      "*   **CompanySize: 200** (Medium-sized, often able to pay competitive salaries)\n",
      "*   **Gender_Male: True** (Historically, may sometimes correlate with higher pay, though ideally a neutral factor)\n",
      "*   **RemoteOnsite_Onsite: True** (Can sometimes command slightly higher pay or be neutral)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Negative/Neutral/Missing Factors:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **PreviousCompanies: 1** (Could be loyal or less varied experience; largely neutral for prediction but some argue less job hopping can mean less salary growth)\n",
      "*   **CommuterSupport: 0, Gym: 0** (Missing benefits, not a direct salary impact but suggests less comprehensive package)\n",
      "*   **Bonus: 0, StockOptions: 0, Retirement: 0** (These are significant parts of total compensation, especially in tech. Their absence means the *base salary* needs to carry more weight, but also might indicate a less generous overall compensation philosophy. This will significantly lower the *total compensation* compared to a role with these benefits, and might even slightly depress the base.)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dominant Negative Factor:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Location: Sri Lanka** (This is the *most critical* factor that will drastically pull down the salary compared to someone with similar qualifications in Western countries or even other Asian tech hubs like Singapore/Dubai. Salaries in Sri Lanka for tech roles, even senior ones, are significantly lower.)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Synthesis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This individual has an excellent profile in terms of experience, education, industry, and job title. However, the location (Sri Lanka) is a major limiting factor for the absolute salary figure. The absence of common tech benefits like bonuses, stock options, and retirement plans also suggests a less generous overall package, which might mean the base salary isn't as high as it could be in a company offering those perks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the high qualifications for the Sri Lankan market, this person would be among the top earners.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   A typical range for a highly skilled Senior/Lead Engineer in Sri Lanka can vary greatly but might be in the LKR 600,000 to LKR 1,000,000+ per month range (approx. LKR 7.2 million to 12 million+ per year).\n",
      "*   Converting to USD (using an approximate rate of 1 USD = 300 LKR):\n",
      "    *   LKR 7.2 million = ~$24,000 USD\n",
      "    *   LKR 12 million = ~$40,000 USD\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the specific attributes (10 years experience, Masters, Lead Engineer, Tech industry, 200 company size, but *no* bonus/stock/retirement), I'd place the base salary towards the higher end of the local market, but not at the absolute peak due to the missing benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Predicted Salary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "I predict the base salary to be around **$35,000 USD per year**.\n",
      "(This equates to approximately LKR 10,500,000 per year or LKR 875,000 per month).\n"
